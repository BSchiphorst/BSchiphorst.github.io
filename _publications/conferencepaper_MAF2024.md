excerpt: ' '
# 'Abstract: Structural threshold models are common industry practice for modelling portfolio credit risk, but often only consider default dependence via underlying common factors. We consider a structural model extension that allows for additionally incorporating default contagion effects. A simulation study illustrates that ignoring default contagion effects may lead to significant underestimation of portfolio tail risk. As a key contribution, we propose a procedure for estimating default contagion parameters from historical default probability data.'
